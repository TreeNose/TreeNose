## Introduction

This is Yanqiao's Artifact Repository for the 23-24 Allegheny senior session. This artifact will demonstrate the feasibility of my senior project: Dynamic interactive code relationship map VSCode extension.

## Motivation

While programmers work, it's nearly impossible to avoid reading nd understanding codes either written by others or yourself. The procedure of reading codes could be painful and time-consuming because of both external and internal reasons like variant or bad documentations, code designs or even coding styles. Code visualization tools represent code in a more intuitive approach while keeping the valuable information about the code. I am inspired by the convenience introduced by code visualization tools and plan my own code visualization tool. While there exists abundant code visualization tools, few of them aims to visualize static inner code relationships among code scopes like function definition/calling. It's a gap my work will fill.

## Technical Details

Get code from VSCode extension. Use a general code parser `tree-sitter` to parse high-level codes to an intermediate code structure. And find code relationships and represent them into graph data and tree structure. Finally display code relationship into a dynamic interactive graph generated by VSCode webview API.

## Future Plans

- Check the feasibility of fetching code with VSCode
- Interact Node-Tree-Sitter with VSCode
